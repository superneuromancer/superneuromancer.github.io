# Hello, World — GitHub Pages

A tiny, pretty starter you can drop into a repository and publish on GitHub Pages.

## Quick start
1. Create a repo named **`yourusername.github.io`** (replace with your GitHub username).
2. Upload the files in this folder to the repo root (or unzip `hello-world-site.zip` and upload).
3. Commit and push. After ~1–2 minutes, open `https://yourusername.github.io` in your browser.

## Customize
- Edit `index.html` to change text.
- Tweak colors or layout in `styles.css`.
- Add tiny interactions in `script.js`.

> This project uses only HTML/CSS/JS, supports dark mode, and respects `prefers-reduced-motion`.
